# Connections Puzzles by coisavioleta

I've created two types of connections puzzles. Most are the regular type, but some are what I call "One of these things is not like the other".  These puzzles follow a pattern where three elements of a category fit, and the fourth is a different sense of the same category name. Some people really like them and others don't. There are also a few weird puzzles that require niche knowledge.
